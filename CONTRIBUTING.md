## Documentation

- [Discord Developer Portal][dc-dev] - navigate left sidebar for API info and docs
- [JavaScript SDK Docs][discordjs] - extremely clean and discriptive docs to supplement in any knowledge gaps left by the dev portal.
- [How to add your bot to a discord server server][bot-token]
    - Note: The [Developer Portal][dc-dev] did not specify how to build the Auth URL; but the [JavaScript SDK Docs][discordjs] had a good explanation.
    - (detailed instructions needed, i.e. pics)

## Go packages

- [discordgo][discordgo] - provides go bindings for the Discord API
- [dgrouter][dgrouter] - command router for discordgo
- [golangci-lint][gocilint] - linter used in remote builds, run locally before pushing

## Other tools

- [LeoV's Embed Visualizer](https://leovoel.github.io/embed-visualizer/) - Preview how some given embed (JSON payload) might appear on Discord, but it also serves as a reference for some limits. This visualization tool does not render all types of embeds. Check out the About page for caveats or consult the [Embed docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-object).
